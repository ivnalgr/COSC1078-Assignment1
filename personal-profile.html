                <p>For me, these tests are a way to further analyse and understand my own personality, habits, and in what situations do I work best in. By having a visualisation and a written report about my own strengths and weaknesses, I can work towards reducing my weaknesses.</p>
                <p>By having these results it could influence behaviour as you are aware of what your strengths are when cooperating with other individuals and become more mindful whether your workflow can apply to everyone in the group or would you have to collectively think of a way to work effectively.
                </p>
                <p>When forming a team it would be best to have people with similar habit and working style in order to finish projects effectively. As compared to having people with different ways of working makes it difficult for other members to work properly together. Variety in group members should also be considered as well as their strengths and weaknesses so that other members can cover for the weaknesses of other members.</p>
