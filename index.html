                <h>ï½žIvan Alegria | s3849118</h>
                <p> name is Ivan Alegria, I was born and raised in Manila, Philippines and moved to Australia in 2014. I am currently in my third year of studying Information Systems majoring in Business Information Systems at RMIT University. The most valuable lesson I have learnt from my subjects has been the importance of managing one's emotions to ensure that effective decisions can be made. I am interested in learning other languages, currently, I know how to speak Filipino, English, Korean and Japanese. I also have a passion for street photography as a way to relieve stress. I hope to continue to build and improve current skills required to excel at real-life experiences.</p>

                <h1>Interest in<span> IT</span> </h1>
                <p>As I am currently majoring in Information Systems, I have a great interest in Information Technology. By learning how systems are designed and implemented in IT, I would be able to use this knowledge and effectively utilise it in my studies to convert data into information for people to understand and make sense of the technology they are using.</p>
                <p>I became interested in Information Technology as I was always surrounded by technology whether it be from going on the computer, playing games, or watching tv. In addition, having both parents working in the fields of IT further increased my interest in the area.</p>
                <p>And as to why i decided to choose to come to RMIT, it was because the university was not too far from home and had a good reputation as well as having an appealing style of teaching.</p>
                <p>By enrolling in my course I expect to learn about new concepts on how to utilise technology to enable our society to function more efficiently. In addition, to improving my current skills and receiving an experience that can be implemented in real-world scenarios.</p>
