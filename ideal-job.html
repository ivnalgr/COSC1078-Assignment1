                <h>Data Analyst</h>
                <p>Data analysis is the process of evaluating and interpreting collected data into useful information which can then be used to help aid business processes such as decision making.</p>
                <p>The position of a data analyst is responsible for turning data into information by using various sources of data and methods of analysis such as descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. After interpreting the data, the individual must be able to develop a report which highlight patterns and trends, in addition to visualising the data in a way that is easy to understand within the business.</p>
                <p>This particular position is appealing to me as during my studies I had the chance to experience how to analyse data and learnt how to use visualisation tools such as tableau. It ended up being a great and fun experience and I thought that I would not mind going deeper into this line of work.</p>
                <p>Skills needed for the position would include knowledge and or experience in data analysis, programming language, software such as SQL, Microsoft Excel, and visualisation tools. As well as problem-solving, collaboration, and interpersonal skills.</p>
                <p>Skills that I currently have include knowledge and experience in SQL, Microsoft Excel, data visualisation (Tableau), data analysis, and some experience in programming with python and HTML. I am also great at problem-solving, communicating, and collaborating with other individuals.</p>
                <p>To obtain skills and further improve current skills I intend to undergo programming courses to cover for my lack of knowledge on languages such as python as well as get hands-on experience. If the opportunity arises, I also plan to receive a graduate internship at a company and receive training on how to properly analyse and transcribe data into information that can support the business's reach objectives.</p>
